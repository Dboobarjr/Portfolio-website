I grew up in Houston,TX for the first 19 years of my life before finally 
deciding to move out and start my own life. I've worked in food service
since I could work but now I'm transitioning into tech!

                <p>
I like to fill my time with a few different hobbies. I enjoy everything
from working out to playing D&D with my friends. I'm also a massive
nature lover! I love to go camping and hiking, nothing is better than
waking up to the morning sun after sleeping under the stars all night!

                <p>
I've played video games since I was young and I feel like almost anyone
who has played games has atleast at one point in their lives wanted to
pick up coding. I've always had a small interest in coding but it 
wasn't until I started studying philsophy that the idea of coding 
became more appealing. The overlap in how you structure your mind
and problem solving are very similar. I think learning to code will 
be a valuable asset in developing myself in many aspects of my life!
